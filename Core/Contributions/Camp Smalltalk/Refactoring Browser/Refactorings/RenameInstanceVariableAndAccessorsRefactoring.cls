	"Find the accessors, if present, then change the instvar, then rename any accessors found.  We must find the accessors first before the instVar renaming makes them more complicated to detect.  We cannot both find and rename them before the super transform, because its call of #performChange:around: partially hides uneffected prior changes, so it renames the instVar in the renamed accessors but then cannot find their protocols to recompile them."
