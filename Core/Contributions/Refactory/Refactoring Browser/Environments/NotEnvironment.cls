NotEnvironment comment: 'NotEnvironment is a <BrowserEnvironmentWrapper> which includes all methods in the system that are not in the <BrowserEnvironment> it wraps. NotEnvironments are constructed by sending the #not message to an existing <BrowserEnvironment>.

Note that a NotEnvironment may include classes that are also included in the environment it inverts, because both may include methods of that class if the original environment includes only a slice of methods in the class.'!
