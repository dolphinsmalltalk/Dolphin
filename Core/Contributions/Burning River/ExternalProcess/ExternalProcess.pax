28-Feb-2003	Added millisecondsToWait.  Changed so that by default #executeSync
		will wait infinitely for the spawned process to complete.
22-Jun-2004	Added comment provided by Peter Kenny explaining how the various 
		directories used when spawning a process are related and used.
28-Jul-2004	Added processExitCode and threadExitCode instance variables and
			accessors.
		Added #executeCommand:inDirectory:waitForSeconds:stdin:stdout:stderr.
		Added STILL_ACTIVE to Win32Constants.
14-Mar-2009	Added PROCESS_INFORMATION compileDefinition to the pre-install
			script.  This classes structure definition is apparently not compiled in
			the base image.'.
