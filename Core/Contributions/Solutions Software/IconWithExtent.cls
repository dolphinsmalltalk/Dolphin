IconWithExtent comment: '`IconWithExtent` is obsolete, but retained for backwards compatibility with existing references in code and in binary filed view resources.

`Icon` itself now supports the ability to request realization at a particular extent for use in cases where a Windows API is expecting an icon of a particular size.'!
