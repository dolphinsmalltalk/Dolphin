IP_UNIDIRECTIONAL_ADAPTER_ADDRESS comment: '<IP_UNIDIRECTIONAL_ADAPTER_ADDRESS> is an <ExternalStructure> class to wrap the struct ''Win32.IP_UNIDIRECTIONAL_ADAPTER_ADDRESS'' from type information in the ''Win32 API (ANSI). Derived from Bruce McKinney´s Hardcore Visual Basic Type Library'' library.

The type library contains no documentation for this struct

Warning: This comment was automatically generated from the struct''s type information, but any changes made here will not be overwritten if the wrapper class is regenerated.

IDL definition follows:

typedef 
struct tagIP_UNIDIRECTIONAL_ADAPTER_ADDRESS {
	unsigned long NumAdapters;
	unsigned long Address[1];
} IP_UNIDIRECTIONAL_ADAPTER_ADDRESS;
