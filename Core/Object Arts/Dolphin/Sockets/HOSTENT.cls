HOSTENT comment: '<HOSTENT> is an <ExternalStructure> class to wrap the struct ''Win32.HOSTENT'' from type information in the ''Win32 API'' library.

The type library contains the following helpstring for this struct
	"Stores information about a given host, such as host name, IPv4 address, and so forth. An application should never attempt to modify this structure or to free any of its components. Furthermore, only one copy of the hostent structure is allocated per thread."

Warning: This comment was automatically generated from the struct''s type information, but any changes made here will not be overwritten if the wrapper class is regenerated.

IDL definition follows:

typedef [uuid(87B4C5F4-026E-11D3-9FD7-00A0CC3E4A32), helpstring("Stores information about a given host, such as host name, IPv4 address, and so forth. An application should never attempt to modify this structure or to free any of its components. Furthermore, only one copy of the hostent structure is allocated per thread.")]
struct tagHOSTENT {
	[readonly, helpstring("The official name of the host (PC). If using the DNS or similar resolution system, it is the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) that caused the server to return a reply. If using a local hosts file, it is the first entry after the IPv4 address.")] LPCSTR h_name;
	[readonly, helpstring("A NULL-terminated array of alternate names.")] void** h_aliases;
	[readonly, helpstring("The type of address being returned.")] short h_addrtype;
