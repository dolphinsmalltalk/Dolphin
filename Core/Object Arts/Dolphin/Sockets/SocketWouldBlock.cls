SocketWouldBlock comment: 'This exception signals that a WinSock function call has been made that would normally cause a Socket to block the current thread. In the old asynchronous Sockets Connection package this was intercepted internally by the Socket to block the current Smalltalk process by waiting on a semaphore. It is no longer used in the new Dolphin Sockets package, and so should be considered deprecated.'!
