Net.SocketWriteStream comment: 'This class represents a buffered write stream for sending data across a Socket connection.

From an implementation perspective this class is similar to FileStream, in that it uses the inherited stream collection as a buffer, overridding certain operations to note when the buffer is dirty. Data is not sent to the underlying socket until the stream is explictily flushed, or the buffer overflows.'!
