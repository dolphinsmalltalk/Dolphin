IID comment: 'IID is the class of 128-bit Globally Unique Identifiers (guids) which are specifically used to uniquely identify interfaces in COM.

Many interfaces are not recorded in the registry, but if they have marshalling support (a proxy/stub DLL) then they will be registered under HKCR\Interfaces. Registered IIDs will display with their registered name, otherwise the string representation of their GUID is printed.'!
