OS.COM.OLEStructure comment: '`OS.COM.OLEStructure` is an `External.Structure` the primary purpose of which is to group all OLE/COM related structure classes. OLEStructure also provides the basic boilerplate initialization needed for structures which have a ''sizeof'' member at offset 0 (see `OS.COM.LICINFO` for an example).'!
