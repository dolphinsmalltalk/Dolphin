IEnumUnknown comment: '<IEnumUnknown> is a wrapper class for the custom interface ''OBJIDL.IEnumUnknown'' generated from type information in the ''ObjIDL Library'' library. It contains methods to invoke the member functions exposed by that interface.

IEnumUnknown and subclasses are used for enumerating over collections of COM interface pointers.

Implementation Note: IUnknown>>fromAddress: increments the reference count of the COM object it wraps, the result is effectively a standalone pointer which is valid outside the scope of the original owner of the pointer. This means that it is not necessary to take any special action here to extend the life of the objects pulled back by nextAvailable[:] since there lifetime is independent of the buffer used to retrieve them.'!
