batchSize
	"Answer the number of elements to retrive per hit. 
	Implementation Note: By default we retrieve 32 at a time to cut down the
	number of calls across the interface, but you may find that some IEnumXXXX
	implementations don't work correctly for more than one item at a time
	because VB only asks for one each time. If that is the case and a For..Each
	seems to work in VB, then try overriding this to answer 1. On the other hand
	if each Next call is very expensive (i.e. it is remote) then one can override
	to increase the batch size)."
