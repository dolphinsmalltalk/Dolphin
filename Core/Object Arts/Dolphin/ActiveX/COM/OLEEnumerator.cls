approxSize
	"Private - Answer the approximate size of the receiver.
	Implementation Note: The size of enumerators must be calculated (no tally
	is kept), which is expensive, so we revert to the basic collection
	implementation."

collect: transformer
	"Evaluate the <monadicValuable> argument, transformer, for each of the 
	receiver's elements in the order defined by the receiver's implementation of #do:.
	Answer a new collection like the receiver containing the values returned by 
	transformer on each evaluation.
	Implementation Note: #size is very slow on an OLE enumerator (it has to be calculated
	by enumerating the collection), so override to avoid it."

	"Private - Answer an empty copy of the receiver (which must be of the exact same class
	not just the same #species), with sufficient capacity for anInteger number of elements.
	Implementation Note: This is not possible for an OLEEnumerator, so answer an empty 
	<OrderedCollection>"

	^self species new: anInteger!

copySize
	"Private - Answer the size of empty copy to create when performing various
	copying/collecting transformations against the receiver.
	Implementation Note: Override because #size is slow, and we copy into
