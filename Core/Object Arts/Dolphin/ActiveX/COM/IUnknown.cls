IUnknown comment: '<IUnknown> is a wrapper class for the COM interface ''stdole.IUnknown'' originally generated from type information in the ''OLE Automation'' library. It contains methods to invoke the member functions exposed by that interface.

IUnknown is the fundamental interface supported by all COM objects and is therefore ubiquitous for any component regardless of implementation. IUnknown includes behaviour to control object lifetime by reference counting, and for  interface negotiation using QueryInterface.

Note that most of Dolphin''s supporting behaviour wrapping IUnknown is implemented in the superclass in order not to overwhelm the fundamental simplicity of IUnknown.'!
