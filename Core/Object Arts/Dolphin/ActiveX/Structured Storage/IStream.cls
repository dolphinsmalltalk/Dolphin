IStream comment: 'IStream is a COMInterface class to wrap the standard OLE/COM structured storage interface of the same name.

IStream expands on ISequentialStream to offer the ability to access and adjust the current stream position, and to lock ranges of bytes in the underlying device (ILockBytes). It also offers transactional control, "directory" information, and copying. IStream is widely implmented and (in particular) used by COM objects for persistent storage purposes, marshalling, etc.

This interface class was originally automatically generated from a type library itself generated from the MS IDL file ''objidl.idl''. Our implementation also adds additional streaming capabilites in order that IStream pointers can be used interchangeably with standard Smalltalk streams, e.g. as a destination for binary filing. In fact IStream implements the ANSI standard stream protocols <puttableStream> and <gettableStream>.

We have also implemented the <streamableFile> protocol on IStreams so that a <FileStream> can be layered on top to take advantage of the latters high-performance buffering. This significantly reduces the number of calls made through the interface, and is the preferred mode of operation in most cases as it is much more efficient. It also allows the IStream to be treated as a gettable text stream (we only support binary streams for reading here).

Example:
	stm := IStream onHGLOBAL.		"Create an OLE stream onto a block of memory..."
	''Hello'' binaryStoreOn: stm.		"...STB an object onto it..."
	stm reset.				"...rewind..."
	(STBInFiler on: stm) next.		"...rehydrate the STB''d object..."
	stm close.				"...finally, close the stream (though finalization would do this anyway."'!
