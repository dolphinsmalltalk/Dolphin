OLELockFileBytes comment: 'OLELockFileBytes is an implementation of the <ILockBytes> interface on to an arbitrary <File>. It is useful because the system does not provide a standard implementation of ILockBytes against a file, which makes it difficult to connect an <IStream> to an arbitrary file without first copying its contents into a global memory block.'!
