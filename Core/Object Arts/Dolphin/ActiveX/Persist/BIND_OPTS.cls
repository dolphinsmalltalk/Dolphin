BIND_OPTS comment: 'BIND_OPTS is an external structure class to represent the OLE moniker structure of the same name.

BIND_OPTS is used to specify options to be taken account of when a moniker is being bound. These options are set into the bind context with IBindCtx:::SetBindOptions, and retrived with IBindCtx::GetBindOptions.

BIND_OPTS has been superceded by BIND_OPTS2 with the advent of DCOM.'!
