Copyright (c) Object Arts Ltd 2000.

This package wraps the fundamental OLE persistence interfaces in the IPersist hierarchy. These interfaces are implemented by COM objects that support persistence to OLE structure storage streams (IStreams), and less commonly onto blocks of memory (through IPersistMemory). Most Active-X controls, for example, support IPersistStream(Init).'.

package basicPackageVersion: '6.0'.

	"Load an object from the specified stream, answering the specified interface on

	This is equivalent to the following steps:
		1. Call ReadClassStm() to get the CLSID of the object from the stream.
		2. Call CoCreateInstance() to instantiate the object.
		3. Query the object for IPersistStream. 
		4. Call IPersistStream::Load to load the object's persistent state.

oleSaveToStream: pPStm pStm: pStm
	"Save an object with the specified IPersistStream interface to the specified IStream.
	This is equivalent to the following steps:

		2. Write the CLSID to the IStream with the WriteClassStm function.
		3. Call the IPersistStream::Save method with fClearDirty set to TRUE, to save the object
		to the IStream (clearing the dirty bit).

	Note that contrary to what the Win32 help says, the pPStm argument cannot be NULL.
