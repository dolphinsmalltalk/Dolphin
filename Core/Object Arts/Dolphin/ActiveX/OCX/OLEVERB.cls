OLEVERB comment: '<OLEVERB> is an <ExternalStructure> class to wrap the struct ''Win32.OLEVERB'' from type information in the ''Win32 API (ANSI). Derived from Bruce McKinney´s Hardcore Visual Basic Type Library'' library.

The type library contains no documentation for this struct

Warning: This comment was automatically generated from the struct''s type information, but any changes made here will not be overwritten if the wrapper class is regenerated.

IDL definition follows:

typedef 
struct tagOLEVERB {
	long lVerb;
	LPWSTR lpszVerbName;
	DWORD fuFlags;
	DWORD grfAttribs;
} OLEVERB;
