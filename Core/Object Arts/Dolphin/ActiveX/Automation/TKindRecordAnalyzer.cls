TKindRecordAnalyzer comment: 'TKindRecordAnalyzer is a class which wraps an Active-X Automation <ITypeInfo> interface pointer that describes a ''struct'' (a C structure). It adds high level behaviours for analyzing the type information associated with structures, and for automatic generation of <ExternalStructure> wrapper classes.

At present TKindRecordAnalyzer is not capable to automatically generating a full #defineFields class method. Support for such will be added in a future release. In the meantime a stub #defineFields is emitted that contains an IDL description of the structure in its comment, and the body of which sets the correct byte size for the structure. '!
