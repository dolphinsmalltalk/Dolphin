AXInterfaceTypeAnalyzer comment: 'AXInterfaceTypeAnalyzer is the abstract superclass of <AXTypeInfoAnalyzer>s describing custom COM interfaces (TKindInterfaceAnalyzer) and dispatch interfaces (TKindDispatchAnalyzer).

AXInterfaceTypeAnalyzers wrap <ITypeInfo> pointers from a type library, providing behaviour which allows one to query information and generate wrapper classes appropriate for COM interfaces.

Instance Variables:
	protocol		<MethodProtocol>. Optional protocol grouping the basic methods of the interface.
	isSource		<boolean>. Flag caching whether the described interface is an event source.

Class Variables:
	ReservedDispSelectors	<IdentitySet> of <Symbol>.Selectors which should not be overridden by dispatch interfaces.
	ReservedUnkSelectors	<IdentitySet> of <Symbol>. Selectors which should not be overridden by custom interfaces.

	(i.e. one which may add new methods and properties at run-time)."

isSource
	"Answer whether the receiver is describing a 'source' interface.
	A source interface is an outbound interface through which an object 
	publishes events. It is not implemented by that object, but by its clients.
	This is a very expensive test to calculate, so we cache it for later use.
	Note: Probably due to a limitation of VB, source interfaces are almost 
	always dispinterfaces."
