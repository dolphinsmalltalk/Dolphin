TKindEnumAnalyzer comment: 'TKindEnumAnalyzer is a class which wraps an OLE Automation <ITypeInfo> interface pointer that describes an enumerated type  (i.e. of type TKIND_ENUM). It adds higher level behaviours for analyzing the type information associated with that coclass, and for automatic generation.

TKindEnumAnalyzer generates constants for each of the members of its enumerated type into a <PoolConstantsDictionary> when sent #generate/#generateAs:. Using this facility one can very quickly and easily define a set of constants needed to use some externally defined object or function library, at least when a typelib is available.

The Active-X Component Wizard will automatically generate a constants pool for any type library that contains enumerated types when any structure or interface is generated from that type library.'!

	"Private - Answer a <readableString> name suggested as the (unprefixed) for a global
	generated to represent the receiver's type.
	Implementation Note: All enums are generated into the same pool, so the global is shared
