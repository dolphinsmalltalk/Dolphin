VARIANT_BOOL comment: 'VARIANT_BOOL is an <ExternalStructure> class to represent the Automation type, VARIANT_BOOL, which is VB''s boolean type.

VARIANT_BOOL is a 16-bit signed integer value where -1 is used to represent true, and 0 is used to represent false. This class has a slightly looser definition in that it maps any non-zero value to true on access, and any non-zero/true value to -1 on mutation.'!
