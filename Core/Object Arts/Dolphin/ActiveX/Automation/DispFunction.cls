callback: stub interface: aCOMInterface withArgumentsAt: anAddress 
	"Private - Forward a COM virtual function call as a message to the object which implements
	the IDispatch interface functions in the <COMInterface>, aCOMInterface, with arguments 
	instantiated from the machine stack at the <integer> address, anAddress, corresponding to the
	receivers argument types. Answer the result.

	Implementation Note: IDispatch is typically implemented in a separate object than custom
	interfaces (or the custom part of a dual interface), since the implementation is typically 
	generic, dispatching either to the custom end of a dual interface through ITypeInfo, or 
	through some other common mechanism.
	Errors are not trapped at this level because Invoke() has special error reporting arguments
	that must be filled out."
