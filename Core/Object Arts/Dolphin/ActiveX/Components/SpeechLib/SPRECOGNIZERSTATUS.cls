SPRECOGNIZERSTATUS comment: '<SPRECOGNIZERSTATUS> is an <ExternalStructure> class to wrap the struct ''SpeechLib.SPRECOGNIZERSTATUS'' from type information in the ''Microsoft Speech Object Library'' library.

The type library contains no documentation for this struct

Warning: This comment was automatically generated from the struct''s type information, but any changes made here will not be overwritten if the wrapper class is regenerated.

IDL definition follows:
