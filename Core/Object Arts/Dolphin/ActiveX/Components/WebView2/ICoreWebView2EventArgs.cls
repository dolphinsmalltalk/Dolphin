ICoreWebView2EventArgs comment: '`ICoreWebView2EventArgs` is not defined in the WebView2 IDL, but is defined here to group all the event argument interfaces in an attempt to make the large API easier to navigate and understand. In other words, there is no real is-a relationship, rather this is just a convenient grouping.
