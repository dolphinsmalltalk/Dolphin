IXMLDOMCDATASection comment: '<IXMLDOMCDATASection> is a wrapper class for the COM interface ''MSXML.IXMLDOMCDATASection'' generated from type information in the ''Microsoft XML, version 2.0'' library. It contains methods to invoke the member functions exposed by that interface.

This is a specialized DOM node to represent CDATA nodes, which are quoted/escaped blocks of text that are interpreted literally rather than as markup.'!
