HeapsortAlgorithm comment: 'HeapsortAlgorithm implements the Heapsort algorithm as a sorting strategy for use in conjunction with <SortedCollection>s.

Heapsort is an in-place sort that requires only about O(N log N) to sort N items. Worst cases differ little from average, but it is slower than Quicksort on average.'!
