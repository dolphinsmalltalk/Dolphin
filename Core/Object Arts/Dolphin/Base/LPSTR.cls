LPSTR comment: 'LPSTR is a class to represent pointers to single-byte strings. It is useful where an external function returns a pointer to a character string through a pointer argument, or where a callback function passes in a pointer to a string as an output parameter to be populated.

LPSTR implicitly converts to the referenced string when asked for its value, rather than answering the pointer value itself.'!
