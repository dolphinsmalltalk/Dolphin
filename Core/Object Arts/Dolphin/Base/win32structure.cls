Win32Structure comment: 'Win32Structure is the abstract superclass of all classes that describe <ExternalStructure>s that are a part of the Win32 API. For the most part, these structures hold a <DWORD> byte size as the first field which Windows can use as version information to determine how the structure is to be interpreted. Where available,  this is set using #dwSize:.
