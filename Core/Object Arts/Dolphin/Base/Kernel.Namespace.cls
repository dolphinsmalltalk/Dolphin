Kernel.Namespace comment: 'Behavior common to all <Namespace>s, although as Classes are namespaces much of the namespace functionality is already implemented on `Class`. `Namespace` adds dictionary protocol. All the behaviour is implemented on the class side as `Namespaces` never have any instances.

We tend to define sub-namespaces as subclasses of the enclosing namespace. This is a slight misuse of subclassing since a sub-namespace is not really a sub-type of its enclosing namespace in a behavioural sense, however it is convenient and means that existing tooling presents the hierarchy in a useful way.

Terminology:

Absolute name - Fully qualified name including ''Root.Smalltalk'', e.g. Root.Smalltalk.Core.Object
Full name - Fully qualified name below Root , e.g. Core.Object
Simple name - Unqualified name, e.g. Object
Short name - A name bindable in Smalltalk, preferring unqualified form where possible.
