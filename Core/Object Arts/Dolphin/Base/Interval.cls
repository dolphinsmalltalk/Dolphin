Interval comment: '<Interval>s represent a finite arithmetic progressions, that is a <sequencedReadableCollection> of numbers across a specified range and with a specified step between each element.

Instance Variables:
	start	<number>. First element in the collection.
	stop	<number>. Last element in the collection.
	step	<number>. Difference between elements of the collection (approximate where the elements are Floats)
