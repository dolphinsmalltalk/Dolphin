Category comment: 'The abstract Category class is used to organize <Class> and <CompiledMethod> objects into subgroupings independent of the implementation hierarchy. This structuring is for the benefit of the user navigating through thousands of classes and methods in the Dolphin Smalltalk development system, and has no run-time significance.

Instance Variables:
	name	<String> name of the receiver, unique in the system.
	comment	<String> description of the category, for documentary purposes.

Class Variables:
	PermanentCategories		<Set> of all categories which are always available, even if empty

<= comperand
	"Answer whether the receiver is less than or equal to the <Category>,
	comperand."

	"Answer whether the receiver is considered equal to the <Object>, comperand."

	^self species == comperand species and: [self name equals: comperand name]!

acceptsAdditions
	"Answer whether new members can be added to the receiver.
	Generally speaking pseudo categories do not accept additions, and
	ordinary categories do. Some types of non-pseudo virtual categories
	can have methods added to them."

	^self isPseud not!

addClass: class
	"Add the <Class>, class, to the collection of classes associated with the receiver."

	^self subclassResponsibility!

asString
	"Answer the string representation for the receiver."

	^self name!

contents
	#deprecated.
	^self subclassResponsibility!

displayOn: aStream
	"Append the receiver to aStream in a format that a user would want to see"

	aStream nextPutAll: self name!

hash
	"Answer the <integer> hash value for the receiver."

	^self name hash!

isEmpty
	"Answer whether the receiver is an empty category (with no members)"

	^self contents isEmpty!

isIntermediate
	"Private - Answer whether the receiver is a temporary category used only as a 
	branch node in a category tree."

isPseud
	"Answer whether the receiver is a pseudo (i.e. not a 'real') category.
	Pseudo categories have dynamically calculated contents, and may not accept 
	additions."

	^self isVirtual!

isVirtual
	"Answer whether the receiver is a virtual category, i.e. one that
	has calculated contents. All pseudo-categories are virtual, but not vice versa."
