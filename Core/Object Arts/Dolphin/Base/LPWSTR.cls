LPWSTR comment: 'LPWSTR is a class to represent pointers to Unicode strings. It is useful where an external function (or COM method call) returns a pointer to a wide character string through a pointer argument. An example being the IEnumString interface.

LPWSTR implicitly converts to the referenced Unicode string when asked for its value, rather than answering the pointer value itself.
