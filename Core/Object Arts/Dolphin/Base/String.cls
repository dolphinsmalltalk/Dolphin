String comment: '`String` is the abstract class of `ArrayedCollection`s representing strings of `Character`s (although note that the Character''s represent code units when accessed by index, and may not constitute a full Unicode code point). 

String has subclasses for strings in the most common encodings, e.g. Ansi (`AnsiString`), UTF-8 (`Utf8String`), and UTF-16LE (`Utf16String`). 

The default and preferred string type is `Utf8String`, representing UTF-8 encoded strings, however many Windows APIs will expect to be passed (and will return) UTF-16LE encoded strings. `Utf16String` is the concrete subclass to  represent UTF-16LE encoded strings. Conversion between the string encodings is easy and fast using `asAnsiString`, `asUtf8String` and `asUtf8String`, although when converting the Unicode encodings to `AnsiString`s some characters cannot be represented and so will be "lost" (i.e. substitued with the replacement character). When working with `WriteStream`s backed by strings it is not necessary to explicitly translate to the target encoding as the class library and VM primitives will transparently convert from whatever string encoding is written.

N.B. Dolphin Strings are, unlike Smalltalk-80 strings, null-terminated. Space for the null terminator is implicity included when a `String` is allocated, but is not reported when the size of the `String` is requested.

`String` complies with the following ANSI Smalltalk protocols:

	"Ideally this should be fixed to Windows-1252, as the current code page may vary by machine
	and so is not suitable for persisted strings, but historically we have used the current ANSI
	code page because the Win32 'A' apis do. In order to continue to interpret pre-existing
	strings as before on any particular users machine, this will be the machine's current code
	page. If, however, the machine's code page is a multi-byte code page, then it will be
	Windows-1252 instead, because Dolphin's ANSI string implementation does not work correctly
	with multi-byte strings anyway. Going forwards the use of Unicode strings (e.g. Utf8String)
	is recommended."
