Core comment: '`Core` is the top-level namespace containing the fundamental classes in the Smalltalk class hierarchy, e.g. `Object`, `Collection`, `Integer` and `String`. It contains all the classes, and those of similar ilk, that you might find in the Smalltalk-80 ''Purple book''. Applications will typically make extensive use of these classes, referring to them directly, and as literal instances.'!
