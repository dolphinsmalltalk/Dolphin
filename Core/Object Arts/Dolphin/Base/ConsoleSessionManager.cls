ConsoleSessionManager comment: 'ConsoleSessionManager is the class of <SessionManager>s used to manage the life-cycle of a deployed console, or command-line, application.

The main entry point hook is the #main method. The program logic can be implemented entirely in #main in the case of simple applications, but it is recommended that a separate application class be constructed, with additional support classes as required. A console application normally exits when the #main method returns.

The standard C I/O streams, stdin/stdout/stderr, can be accessed by sending the #stdin, #stdout, and #stderr messages to the session. The resulting streams implement the full Smalltalk Stream protocols, and can be used interchangeably with normal streams. Furthermore these are connected to the actual C runtime library streams of the same name, and so calling C runtime library functions such as printf() (either from within Dolphin, or a DLL called from Dolphin) will result in output to the same console window. Note that these streams (and the console) are actually usable from <GUISessionManager>s too, which is useful for testing and debugging console applications from within the develoopment environment. The class side #run method provides a simple way to fire up a console application in the development environment, although the session manager is not actually installed.

A simple example of a console application is the command line version of the Hello World sample. Try it out be evaluating:

	CommandLineHelloWorld run    "Watch out for the appearance of the console, and press ENTER to continue"

registerConsoleCtrlHandler
	#todo "Rather ironically, registering a console ctrl handler does not work very well in a console app any more.  The signal is delivered on a background thread, which the Dolphin VM will marshal across the to main 	thread by sending it via the message queue. In a typical console application that is not going idle, the  signal will not be received.
	One way to solve this would be to add a console control handler to the VM and send through the events to the image using the interrupt mechanism. In the meantime, don't register a handler so that Ctrl+C will perform the default action and above the app."
