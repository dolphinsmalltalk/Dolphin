Core.PositionableStream comment: 'PositionableStream is the abstract class of <SequencedStream>s for which stream over sequence values from a Smalltalk sequenceable collection. Sub-instances of PositionableStream conform to the ANSI <collectionStream> protocol.

Note that some inconsistencies arise when streaming over multi-byte string encodings, such as UTF-8. The position reported by the stream, and that to which it can be set, is always expressed as a code unit position. This has a number of consequences to be aware of:
- Reading a single character may advance the position by more than one code unit position. In the case of UTF-8 characters are represented by 1 to 4 code units, so ReadStream>>next will increment the position between 1 and 4 bytes.
- The stream position can be set to be in the middle of a character if chosen without consideration. For example adjusting the position by using #skip: should generally be avoided - it is better to remember a position, and reset to that. 

Instance Variables
	position		<Integer> 0 based offset of the current code unit position in the stream
	readLimit		<Integer> Either the maximum read position in the stream, or the position up to which the stream has previously been read (depends on subclass).'!
