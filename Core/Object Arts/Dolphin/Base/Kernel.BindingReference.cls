Kernel.BindingReference comment: '`BindingReference` is the abstract superclass of binding reference objects.

`BindingReference`s represent symbolic references to static variables in the system. They describe a path through nested namespaces to locate a particular `VariableBinding`, with an optional context specifying the root namespace from which to start resolving the binding path.

`BindingReference` has a literal syntax of the form #{<identifier>}, where <identifier> can be an unqualified or dot qualified name. If unqualified then the binding reference is assumed to be relative to the method in which it is defined, and so should follow the same binding rules as an unqualified identifier that might appear in the code of the same method. Note that this may also find static variables in enclosing or imported scopes. If the identifier is qualified, then it is assumed to be an absolute reference to be bound starting in Smalltalk. Because Smalltalk is directly nested in `Root` (the root namespace), starting the binding search in `Smalltalk` will also find variables accessible using the same path from `Root` even if they are not part of a namespace imported into `Smalltalk`. For those cases where a partially qualified relative reference is required, the first component of the name can be an underscore, in which case the compiler regards it as a relative reference even though it contains more than one name component.

It might have been better if literal binding references were always relative, unless having a special prefix or other marker, or conversely always relative unless so marked. However there is an established precedent in the ecosystem, hence the rather confusing implicit distinction between the treatment of single and multi-part names for literal binding references.

## Class Variables:
  `Generation`		`<integer>`. Latest valid generation. Incremented whenever a system change is made that could alter binding resolution, e.g. addition of a new class.
