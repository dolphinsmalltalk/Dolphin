PluggableLookupTable comment: 'PluggableLookupTable is the class of <LookupTable>s which support a pluggable <searchPolicy>, and which can thus be configured to behave in the same way as either standard <LookupTable>s (equality search) or <IdentityDictionary>s (identity search), or indeed any user-defined search policy.

Instance Variables:
	searchPolicy		<searchPolicy>. The policy used to hash and compare elements of the receiver.
