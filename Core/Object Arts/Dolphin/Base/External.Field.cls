External.Field comment: 'ExternalField is the abstract class of metadata objects that describe the fields of <ExternalStructure>s, including such attributes as the byte offset of the field, the type of the field, and potentially the size of the field.

Instance Variables:
	offset		<SmallInteger>. Fixed offset, in bytes, of the field described in any instance of structClass.
	structClass	<ExternalStructure class> of which the instance is describing a field.
