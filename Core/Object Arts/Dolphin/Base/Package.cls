However, the historic behaviour was to declare classes, so for the time being this is still on by default. The setting can either be changed globally (i.e. `Package declareClassesOnLoad: false`) or for individual packages using the `preDeclareClassesOnLoad` property on the instance side. If the property is set, then it will be persisted to the package file and respected by future loads. In the next major release of Dolphin, this property will default to 'false'. The reason for this is that pre-declaration is relatively expensive (causing a class mutation when the actual class declaration is subsequently loaded), and so worth avoiding when not required."
