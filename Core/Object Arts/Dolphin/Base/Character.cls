Character comment: 'Character is the class of objects which serve as the elemental values of Smalltalk Strings. There is a finite set of Characters (256 in the current Dolphin implementation). Smalltalk characters have a literal syntax which is the $ symbol followed by the normal printed representation of the character. Dolphin also supports the following escaped literal formats to provide a literal representation of any character:
	$\0	- Null
	$\a	- Bell
	$\b	- Backspace
	$\t	- Tab
	$\n	- Newline
	$\v	- Vertical tab
	$\f	- Form Feed
	$\r	- Carriage return
	$\x<HH> - where <HH> is the hex representation of the character''s code point - can be used to represent any character in the set.

Note that the ANSI standard does not require that Characters be identity objects, but they are in Dolphin.

	to optimize this routine. In particular we try to avoid performing any
	work in the common cases where the string is either empty, or does not
