	1	Reserved.
	2	Syntax Check only.
	4	Reserved.
	8	Turn off optimization
	16	Generate a textmap from ip to a text range as the third element of
		the array. The text map is an Array of Integers.
		Every three elements define one map. The first element in a map is the
		ip of the bytecode (1 based), and the two following elements define
		the start and stop of the text range (1 based) associated with the
		action of the bytecode.	
	32	Generate a temporaries map as the fourth element of the array
		The temporaries map is itself an Array. Every two elements of the 
		array refer to one mapping. A mapping has two elements, an ip and a
		String of temporaries that are valid at the ip. A mapping occurs for
		every time the temporaries list changes in the method. So the start of
		a Block with at least one argument will have an entry, the ending of
		it will also have an entry. Temporaries generated by the optimizer that
		may be ignore have an underscore as their first character. Optimizer
		temporaries are ignore when deciding that the temporaries list has
		changed. Mappings are not necessarily ordered by their ip. Two mappings
		may have the same ip in this case of an optimized empty block.
	64	Generate a debug version of the method which includes break points after
		every expression. Any text/temporaries map generated at the same time will
		account for the extra byte codes in the IP offsets.
	512	Interactive compile (compiler can prompt to define globals etc)
	1024	SendYourself. Don't optimize out #yourself
