	"Private - Write the address of the externally addressable Smalltalk object, anObject,
	into anExternal at the receiver's offset.
	N.B. Precautions must be taken (such as saving the Object as an
	instance variable of the ExternalStructure which encapsulates anExternal)
	to prevent anObject being garbage collected, which will invalidate its
	address. anObject cannot be saved by the receiver, because it is shared
	among all instances of a subclass of ExternalStructure (it is part of
	the class instance variable 'template')."
