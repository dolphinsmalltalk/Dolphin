Time comment: '`Time` is the class whose instances represent a time of day as the number of seconds since midnight with infinite precision.

Time is a legacy Smalltalk class that represents only a time of day, without any awareness of timezone offset. They are generally assumed to represent a local time. For most purposes you will want to use a `DateAndTime` instead.'!
