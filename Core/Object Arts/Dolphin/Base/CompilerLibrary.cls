CompilerLibrary comment: 'CompilerLibrary is the <ExternalLibrary> to represent the Dolphin Smalltalk compiler.

In versin 3.0 the compiler is actually implemented as a COM object, but to avoid the necessity of making the OLE COM package part of the base image, the VM exposes some simple wrapper functions which have the same signature as the 2.x compiler API.'!
