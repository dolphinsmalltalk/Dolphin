UndefinedObject comment: 'UndefinedObject is the singleton class of the distinguished object, <nil>.

<nil> is the initial value of all new variables (instance or otherwise), and hence a  primary purpose of UndefinedObject is to provide a means of detecting errors, especially those resulting from the failure to correctly initialize variables.

<nil> is also useful for explicitly representing a null value, e.g. in a variable which has no value. A common use of this type is in conjunction with lazy initialization. In this respect <nil> has a similar purpose to the SQL <null> value.

When interfacing to external functions, etc, <nil> is treated as the null pointer, or zero, as appropriate to the parameter type.

UndefinedObject implements the following ANSI protocols:
	<Object>
	<nil>'!

	nilBlock."

	unless #perform'd."

	can represent."

	if it is passed/returned to an external library function as the Null pointer.
