Magnitude comment: 'Magnitude is an abstract class which provides the protocol objects which can be compared
along a linear dimension, e.g. Numbers, Dates, Times.

Subclasses of Magnitude must implement the following comparing protocol (at the very least):
#<, #=, #hash'!

< operand
	"Answer whether the receiver is less than the <magnitude>, operand.

	Only this relational operator need be implemented by subclasses, since the others can 
	be implemented in terms of it (though performance may dictate otherwise)."

	^self subclassResponsibility!

<= operand
	"Answer whether the receiver is less than or equal to the <magnitude>, operand.
	Implemented in terms of #<, which must be implemented by subclasses."

	^(operand isNaN or: [operand < self]) not!

= aMagnitude
	"Answer whether the receiver is equivalent to the argument, aMagnitude."

	^self subclassResponsibility!

> operand
	"Answer whether the receiver is greater than the <magnitude>, operand.
	Implemented in terms of #<, which must be implemented by subclasses."

	^operand < self!

>= operand
	"Answer whether the receiver is greater than or equal to the <magnitude>, operand.
	Implemented in terms of #<, which must be implemented by subclasses."

	^(operand isNaN or: [self < operand]) not!

between: min and: max
	"Answer whether the receiver is inclusively between the <magnitude> arguments, 
	min and max."

	^self >= min and: [self <= max]!

hash
	"Answer a SmallInteger hash value for the receiver which obeys the invariant that any two 
	objects which compare equal (using #=) must have the same hash value (but not 
	necessarily vice-versa). Like #=, and #<, must be implemented by subclasses."

isNaN
	"Answer whether the receiver is Not a Number."

	^false!

max: operand
	"Answer the greater of the receiver and the <magnitude>, operand.
	 Implementation Note: #< is used since other relational operators are often implemented 
	in terms of it."
