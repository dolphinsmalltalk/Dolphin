AbsoluteFileLocator comment: 'An AbsoluteFileLocator is used to indicate the location of an external file that may be referenced within the image. 
Instances of this class always locate files by their full absolute path.

Try the following examples:

relativePath := FileLocator absolute relativePathTo: SessionManager current imageFileName. "Display It"
FileLocator absolute localFileSpecFor: relativePath. "Display It"'!
