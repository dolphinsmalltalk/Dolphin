Kernel comment: '`Kernel` is the top-level namespace of fundamental classes in the Smalltalk hierarchy that are typically considered part of the implementation, e.g. `CompiledMethod`. `Kernel` contains all the classes you might find in the Smalltalk-80 ''Blue book'' that are not in the ''Purble book''`, and those of similar ilk. Applications do not normally need to refer directly to these classes.'!
