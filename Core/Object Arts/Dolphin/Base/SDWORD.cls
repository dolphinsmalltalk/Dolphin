SDWORD comment: '<SDWORD> is an <ExternalStructure> class to wrap the Win32 type of the same name.

SDWORD is used to represent signed 32-bit integers in conjunction with Win32 APIs. 

The range of integer values that can be represented by instances of this class is defined by the interval:
	(-2**31) to: (2**31)-1
