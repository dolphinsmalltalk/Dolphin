SearchPolicy comment: 'SearchPolicy is for configuring pluggable collections and models to use different searching policies, e.g. equality vs. identity. SearchPolicy itself implements an equality based policy using #= and #hash, etc.

SearchPolicy is the canonical implementation of the <searchPolicy> and <comparisonPolicy> protocols (the latter is really a subset of the former).

The <comparisonPolicy> protocol can be used to compare two objects in order to determine if they are the "same". Different comparison policies can be employed which, for example, consider that two objects are the same iff they are the exact same identical object (i.e. ''''obj1 == obj2'''' is true), or on the other hand if they are of equal value (i.e. ''''obj1 = obj2'''' is true).

SearchPolicy maintains a number of prebuilt instances which implement popular search/comparison policies. These are accessible via class side methods in the ''''instance creation'''' category.

Class Variables:
	Always		<AlwaysSearchPolicy>. Maintains that two objects are always equal.
	Identity		<IdentitySearchPolicy>. Singleton instance for identity searching.
	Equality		<SearchPolicy>. Singleton instance for equality searching.
	Never		<NeverSearchPolicy>. Maintains that two objects are never equal.
