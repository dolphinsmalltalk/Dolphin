QWORD comment: '<QWORD> is an abstract superclass for the two Win32 64-bit integer structures, LARGE_INTEGER (signed), and ULARGE_INTEGER (unsigned).

This class of structures is useful for communication with Win32 services that require 64-bit integer parameters. They also provide for easy access to the high and low 32-bit constituents of the integer''s native representation (Intel format 2''s complement).'!
