Kernel.DeadObject comment: 'DeadObject is a singleton whose sole instance is used to mark the slots previously occupied by dead objects in objects with weak references. This class serves no other purpose than to provide a unique ''Corpse'' object which prints in a recognisable form.

N.B. It is not a good idea to create a new current DeadObject as this may break existing weak collection and/or confuse the VM.

Class Variables:
	Current	<DeadObject>. Singleton instance.
