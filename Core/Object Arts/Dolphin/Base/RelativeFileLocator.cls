RelativeFileLocator comment: 'RelativeFileLocator is the abstract class of <FileLocator>s that can be used to map between an absolute path and a path relative to a certain base directory.
RelativeFileLocators use absolute paths for files outside the local directory hierarchy below the base directory, and relative paths within their local directory hierarchy.'!
