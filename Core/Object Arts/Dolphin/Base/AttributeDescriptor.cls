AttributeDescriptor comment: 'AttributeDescriptor is an abstract class of meta-objects that be used to describe the shape of other objects. It has a subclass, Aspect, instances of which describe how to access object''s published ''aspects'' (e.g. instance variables) through getter and setter methods, and a subclass, ExternalField, instances of which describe the fields of C style structures. Note that these objects are all descriptors, and need to be combined with a subject object in order to become "closed".'!
