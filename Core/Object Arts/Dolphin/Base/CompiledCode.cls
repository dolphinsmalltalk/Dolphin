CompiledCode comment: 'CompiledCode is the class of executable objects containing an array of instructions (bytecodes) and an array of literals (the literal frame).

The method header of the receiver is a SmallInteger containing a set of flags containing information such as the number of arguments, the number of temporaries, etc, is layed out as follows (subject to change):

	Bits:	Use:
	0	SmallInteger flag (not visible in Smalltalk)
	1	Private flag
	2..7	0 for no context, otherwise context Temp count + 1, so up to 63 context temps supported. 
	8..15	Stack Temp count	(i.e. maximum of 256 temps)
	16..23	Arg count		(i.e. maximum of 256 args)
	24..31	Primitive index

Primitive indices 0 thru 8 describe the method type as follows:
	0	Normal method requiring activation
	1	Return self
	2	Return true
	3	Return false
	4	Return nil
	5	Return literal zero
	6	Return an instance variable (see the bytecodes to determine which)
	7	Set an instance variable
	8	Reserved for future use.

Note: These are implementation details, and should not be relied upon as they may be changed in future versions.'!
