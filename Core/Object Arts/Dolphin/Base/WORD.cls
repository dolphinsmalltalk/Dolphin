WORD comment: '<WORD> is an <ExternalStructure> class to wrap the Win32 type of the same name.

WORD is used to represent unsigned 16-bit integers in conjunction with Win32 APIs. 

The range of integer values that can be represented by instances of this class is defined by the interval:
	0 to: (2**16)-1'!
