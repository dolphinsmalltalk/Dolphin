InsertionSortAlgorithm comment: 'InsertionSortAlgorithm implements the simple Insertion Sort algorithm as a pluggable sorting strategy  for use in conjunction with <SortedCollection>s. 

Insertion sort is slow for anything but very small collections, or those which are already nearly sorted, where it is the sorting algorithm of choice.'!
