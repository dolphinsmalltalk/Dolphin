Security.DolphinSureCertificateStore comment: 'A DolphinSureCertificateStore is used to store DolphinSureCertificates for later retrieval.  The implementation uses the Windows Registry under HKEY_CURRENT_USER and certificates are stored as binary bytes (streamed out using STB). They can be looked up by serial number.

Currently, three such stores are defined and can be accessed by the following class methods:

#myCertificates --  is used to store your own personal certificates that have been issued to.  When you receive a certificate it will be in the form of an ST text file with a series of Smalltalk expressions that can be used to regenerate the certificate instance.  Once this is done there is also an expression to store the certificate into your "my certificates" store.

#temporaryTrust -- is used to store certificates for publishers that should be trusted in future, but only within the current Dolphin session.  If a certificate is added to this store then any content from the publisher will be automatically trusted until Dolphin (or the current DolphinSure application) shuts down. For example, if a user chooses to trust the publisher of a particular web applet, the publisher''s certificate will be added to the temporary trust store so that further prompts for each class that is loaded are unnecessary.  This store is cleared down whenever the image starts. This store is used by the Dolphin web applet plug-in but can also be used by other applications.

#permanentTrust -- is used to store certificates for publishers that are to be permanently trusted in future. Certificates are typically added to this store if the user ticks the box marked, "Always trust content from this publisher?", when faced with a SignedClassWarning dialog. This store is used by the Dolphin web applet plug-in but can also be used by other applications.

Instance Variables:
	regKey		<RegKey> identifying the registry location of certificates held by this store.
