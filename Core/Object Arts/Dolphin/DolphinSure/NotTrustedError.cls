NotTrustedError comment: 'A NotTrustedError is signalled to indicate when the load of a binary class file has been prevented by the end-user due to a lack of trust in the publisher of the class. It is either signalled when a digital certificate for a signed class has been refused (in SignedClassStub>>reifyClassUsing:) or when an unsigned class is being loaded and the standard NotSignedCertificate has been refused instead.

Normal policy is to let the error propagate unimpeded and, either bring up a walkback in the development system, or display a warning MessageBox in a run-time system.  However, one might consider trapping this error and performing some other action when an untrusted class load is refused.'!
