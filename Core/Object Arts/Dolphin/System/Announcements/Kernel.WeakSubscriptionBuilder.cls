Kernel.WeakSubscriptionBuilder comment: 'I am a wrapper around an Announcer, used to create weak subscriptions at subscription time.

Use me like this:

anAnnouncer weak subscribe: Announcement send: #foo to: barObject.

I raise an error for block subscriptions, as they require non-existing Ephemeron support to function correctly.'!
