Random comment: 'Random is a subclass of <Stream> that determines its elements based on an algorithm employing a number as a seed. Random itself is abstract, but has various concrete subclasses that implement different pseudo-random number generation algorithms. Attempts to instantiate an instance of Random will answer an instance of the default generator, which is usually the Park & Miller multiplicative congruential generator. This is a good generator, but uses FP arithmetic and is therefore rather slower than the typical quick''n''dirty generator one finds in most C runtime libraries. 

Random provides a concrete implementation of #atEnd, but because the size of the collection is infinite, it never ends.

		RandomCRT new chiSquareTest: 5000000 max: 100		

	It should yield a value in the range 80..120, the nearer to 100 the better."
