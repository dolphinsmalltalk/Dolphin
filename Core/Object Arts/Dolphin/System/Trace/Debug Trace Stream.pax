Copyright (c) Object Arts Ltd, 2002.

This package implements the <puttableStream> protocol on top of the Win32 OutputDebugString() API. Like the Transcript the output is thread safe, and buffered until either an end of line is emitted (i.e. #cr is sent) or the the stream is explicitly flushed (i.e. #flush is sent). For convenience the trace stream is assigned to the global named ''Trace''.

To view trace output you will need a debug output monitor such as the Sysinternals tool ''DebugView'', downloadable from http://www.sysinternals.com

Example usage:

	Trace nextPutAll: ''Hello world''; cr'.

package basicPackageVersion: '6.0'.
