Copyright © Object Arts Ltd, 2002-2020.

This package implements the `<puttableStream>` protocol on top of the Win32 OutputDebugString() API. Output to the stream is buffered until either an end of line is emitted (i.e. `cr` is sent) or the stream is explicitly flushed (i.e. `flush` is sent). Any output to the DebugTraceStream will always be displayed using Smalltalk locale settings, e.g. numbers are displayed in Smalltalk''s literal format.

The DebugTraceStream is just one of the standard options available for diagnostic logging/debugging purposes. Other alternatives are:
1. Transcript
2. Stdio streams (e.g. `SessionManager current stdout`)

The DebugTraceStream has a couple of advantages over these alternatives:
- It is much faster; about 5x faster than the Transcript, and 20x faster than writing to stdout (at least in a GUI app).
- It is only visible when either running under a native debugger, or when using a tool such as DebugView, so it can be left in place in an application without too much impact. This avoids the undesirable behaviour of having output open a console window, in a GUI app, or of needing to include the TranscriptShell as part of the application.

To view trace output you will need a debug output monitor such as the [Sysinternals](http://www.sysinternals.com) tool ''DebugView''.

### Example usage:

```
	stream := DebugTraceStream current.
	stream display: ([1 to: 1000 do: [:i | stream display: i; nextPutAll: '': Hello world ''; cr]] timeToRun); cr
```
