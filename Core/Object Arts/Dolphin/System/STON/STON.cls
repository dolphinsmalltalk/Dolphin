STON comment: 'STON implements serialization and materialization using the Smalltalk Object Notation format.

I am a class side facade offering a high level API to write and read objects using STON.

U s a g e

Basic operations

  #toString:
  #fromString:

  STON toString: DisplayScreen boundingBox.
  STON fromString:  ''Rectangle{#origin:Point[0,0],#corner:Point[1920,1030]}''.

  STON toString: { DateAndTime now. Float pi. 1 to: 10 by: 2. 3 days }.
  STON fromString:  ''[DateAndTime[''''2016-03-15T13:57:59.462422+01:00''''],3.141592653589793,Interval{#start:1,#stop:10,#step:2},Duration{#nanos:0,#seconds:259200}]''

You can also read from or write to streams

  #fromStream:
  #put:onStream:

There is also the option to do pretty printing (indenting, multi line output) 

  #toStringPretty:
  #put:onStreamPretty:

STON is more or less a superset of JSON and is backwards compatible with JSON while parsing, and can be compatible with it while writing. The important differences (and the whole reason why STON exists in the first place) are 

  - class information (except for lists (Array) and maps (Dictionary))
  - proper handling of shared and circular references
  - more Smalltalk-like syntax (Symbols with #, single quoted Strings, nil instead of null)
  - more defined special types (Date, Time, DataAndTime, ByteArray, Point)

Parsing JSON is done using #fromString: or #fromStream: with the results being composed of Arrays and Dictionaries.

Writing objects as JSON is done using: 

  #toJsonString[Pretty]:
  #put:asJsonOnStream[Pretty]:

Note that you can only write Arrays and Dictionaries !!

For a much more sophisticated JSON parser/writer implementation, have a look at NeoJSON.

Like JSON, STON does not allow for comments. However, a preprocessor option can skip C style comments before parsing.

I also define some contants used in the implementation: the class used as list, map and association, as well as the optional class name key (used when reading objects using an unknown class).

The 2 key methods are

  #stonOn:
  #fromSton:

which work together with STONWriter and STONReader; read their class comments for all configuration options (you can use the #reader and #writer methods to avoid referring to these classes directly).

Several methods are used to support and/or control the implementation

  #stonName - defines the external name for a class
  #stonAllInstVarNames - defines which instance variable to write
  #stonContainSubObjects - shortcut looking into objects for subobjects
  #stonShouldWriteNilInstVars - option to skip writing nil valued instance variables
