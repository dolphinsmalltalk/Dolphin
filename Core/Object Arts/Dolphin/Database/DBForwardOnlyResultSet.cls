DBForwardOnlyResultSet comment: 'DBForwardOnlyResultSet is the class of <DBResultSet>s specialised to represent forward-only cursors. Forward-only cursors offer much higher performance, especially against large result sets and/or when operating remotely. Backwards navigation and random access are supported, but may be extrememly slow since the query must be re-run and then the result set stepped through once more to the requested position. Since backwards navigation requires a re-query, the result set will not be "static" and will be affected by any updates, insertions or deletions that have been performed since the initial query.

Note that forward-only cursors typically tie up the entire connection against which they were executed until they are closed. This may make it necessary to open multiple connections when using forward-only cursors.

Instance Variables:
	<position>	<integer> position in the result set, one being the first row.
