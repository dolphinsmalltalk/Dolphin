Debugger comment: 'Debugger is a <SmalltalkToolShell> that implements the standard debugging tool. The debugger is usually invoked from a walkback dialog by pressing the Debug button. Walkbacks are displayed in the development environment when a breakpoint (''self halt'') is encountered, or when an unhandled exception occurs. It is also possible to configure the system so that debuggers are opened automatically when breakpoints are encountered or errors occur (see the Debugger options in Dolphin Options), though this is not particularly recommended as it can make the system crash if the error or breakpoint is in some code that is itself used by the Debugger.

Dolphin''s Debugger does not simulate execution as in some Smalltalk''s, but instead uses the VM''s built-in debugging event generation to run the code and interrupt it at appropriate points. This results in more consistent and faster execution, although note that the debugger will recompile methods being stepped through to insert breakpoints and this may cause some peephole compiler optimisations to be lost.

The protocol <debugEventHandler> shows the messages sent (indirectly via Processor) by the VM when debug events occur such as breakpoints and single-steps. These debug events could quite easily be used for other purposes such as profiling tools. However note that this protocol is private, and may change in future versions. It is worth noting that single-step events are generated by hooking into the message dispatch mechanism in such a way that has no measurable effect on the speed of normal operation, and breakpoints are generated by inserting a breakpoint instruction rather than by performing conditional tests (i.e. the VM does not contain any code to support debugging which would slow down normal operation, and hence there is no separate debug/release build).

Dolphin serializes callback returns to maintain LIFO order on the machine stack even in the presence of multiple threads of execution (Smalltalk Processes) and thus it is quite feasible to debug into callbacks which route through external code such as parts of the OS, for example one can step into a SendMessage call and break in the Dolphin window procedure. One can also debug through COM method invocations, even back into Dolphin, and set breakpoints in COM method implementations that will be actioned even when the COM object is being hosted by an external client such as VB. However this is a Smalltalk debugger, and one cannot use it to debug into external code written in other languages.

Caution: Although modifying the Debugger can be fun it is quite easy to crash the system if a mistake is made. You should also note that if you develop your own custom view the use of a virtual ListView for the stack presenter is not recommended since the stack may change dynamically and become momentarily invalid at just the point that the control requests display details.

	The default is #precise, because this is the long established run-to-cursor behaviour, however you may find #conservative less
	likely to step past where you expect particularly if you are used to line-oriented debuggers. For example #precise may run past 
	the point you are expecting if you run to a cursor that is not actually over some code (e.g. in whitespace at the start or end of a line).
	On the other hand the #conservative mode may not run far as far as the cursor in some circumstances, for example in an assignment
	statement if you run-to-cursor with the cursor over the left hand side the expected behaviour would be for the debugger to stop just
	before the assignment of the value to the variable on the LHS, i.e. after evaluating the right hand side, which is indeed what will happen 
	in #precise mode. In #conservative mode, however, the debugger will stop before evaluating the RHS."
