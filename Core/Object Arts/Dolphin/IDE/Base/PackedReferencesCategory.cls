PackedReferencesCategory comment: 'PackedReferencesCategory is the class of virtual method categories dynamically determines their membership to include only those methods which have packed byte codes and reference a particular object from their literal frame. In practice this will include only those methods that consist of a send to self of a zero argument selector.

PackedReferencesCategory has no instances by default, but you can create your own packed reference categories by following the examples in the class #initialize method.'!
