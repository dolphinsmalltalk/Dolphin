ChangedMethodsCategory comment: 'ChangedMethodsCategory is a virtual method category membership of which is limited to those methods which have unsaved changes (i.e. they are a method of a changed class with source residing in the change log).

Although this class is strictly redundant (it being implementable as a PluggableVirtualMethodCategory), a specialised implemenation is much faster when enumerating the entire contents because the set of candidate behaviours can be limited.'!
