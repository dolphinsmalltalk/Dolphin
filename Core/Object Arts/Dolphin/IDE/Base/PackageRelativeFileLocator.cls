PackageRelativeFileLocator comment: 'PackageRelativeFileLocator is a <RelativeFileLocator> that can be used to map between an absolute path and a path relative to a certain package''s directory. At runtime (i.e. in a deployed application from which packages have been stripped) PackageRelativeFileLocator''s behave in the same way as <ImageRelativeFileLocator>s.

Thanks to Chris Uppal for the original idea behind this class.'!
