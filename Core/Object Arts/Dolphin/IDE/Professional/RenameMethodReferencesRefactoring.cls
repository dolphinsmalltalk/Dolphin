RenameMethodReferencesRefactoring comment: 'RenameMethodReferencesRefactoring is a specialisation of the <RenameMethodRefactoring> that does not rename any implementors. This can be useful when one wishes to adapt code using one selector to another, and occurrence one frequently encounters when porting code from one Smalltalk to another. Note that this may not be behaviour preserving.'!
