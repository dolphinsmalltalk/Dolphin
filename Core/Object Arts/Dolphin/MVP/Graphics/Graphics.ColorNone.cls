Graphics.ColorNone comment: '`ColorNone` is the special `ColorRef` which represents a completely transparent colour. It is used to specify that something should be drawn transparently, or that the background should not be filled.

`ColorNone`s singleton instance is accessed using the expression `Color transparent`.

The superclass `code` instance variable has the value `Win32Constants.CLR_NONE`.'!

alpha
	"Answer the receiver's alpha component (a SmallInteger in the range 0..255). This specifies
	the opacity of the colour, with 0 being completely transparent and 255 completely opaque."

	^0!

alpha: anAlphaInteger
	"Answer a `Color` which has the same red, green and blue components as the receiver, but with the <integer> alpha, anAlphaInteger.
	As the receiver is already completely transparent, the application of further alpha make no difference."

	^self!

alphaMask
	"Private - Answer the receiver's alpha bits as they would compose into an ARGB."

	^0!

argbCode
	"Answer the receiver's colour value in 32-bit ARGB encoding with 8-bits per component in alpha, red, green, blue order.
	Note that we choose to represent Color none/transparent as transparent white."

	^16rFFFFFF!

brush
	"Answer a Brush configured for solid painting of the receiver's color."

	^StockBrush fromId: Win32Constants.NULL_BRUSH!

hls
	"Answer the hue, luminance, and saturation values that correspond to the receiver."

	"Color none is a completely transparent Color white."

hslSaturation
	"Answer a <Number> in the range [0, 1] representing the HSL saturation of the receiver."

	"Color none is a completely transparent Color white."

hsv
	"Answer a three-element <Array> containing the hue, saturation and brightness values that describe the receiver in the HSV colour system."

	"Color none is a represented as a completely transparent white."

hsvSaturation
	"Answer a <Number> in the range [0,1] representing the HSV saturation of the receiver."

	"Color none is a completely transparent Color white."

hue
	"Answer a <Number> in the range [0,360] representing the receiver's hue in the HSV or HLS color models."

isNone
	"Answer whether the receiver is the special <Color> representing no colour."

	^true!

luminance
	"Behaves as Color white for this purpose, but with zero alpha."

name
	"Answer the symbolic name of the colour, or nil if it does not have a name (or known name)."
