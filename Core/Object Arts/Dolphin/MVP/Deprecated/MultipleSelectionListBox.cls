MultipleSelectionListBox comment: 'MultipleSelectionListBox was deprecated in 6.0 - instances should be replaced by <ListBox> instances configured to operate in one of the multiple selection modes.  Note that ListBox corrects the historical design error in MultipleSelectionListBox in that the single selection protocols (#selection[:], #selectionByIndex[:], etc) always operate on a single item (this class redefines the single selection protocols to operate on collections). For multiple selections the multiple selection protocols (e.g. #selections[:], #selectionsByIndex[:], etc) must be used.'!
