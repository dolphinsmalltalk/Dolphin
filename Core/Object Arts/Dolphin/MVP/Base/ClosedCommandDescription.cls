ClosedCommandDescription comment: 'ClosedCommandDescription is the class of <CommandDescription>s that have a pluggable implementation of #queryCommand: such that they can be completely self contained, both describing the command to be performed, where to send it, and also managing enablement/disablement.

Instance Variables:
	queryBlock	<monadicValue> implementation of #queryCommand:. Can be nil.
	receiver		<Object> to which the command will be sent. Can be nil, in which case queryBlock determines receiver.
