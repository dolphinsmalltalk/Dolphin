ColorNone comment: '`ColorNone` is the special `ColorRef` which represents a completely transparent colour. It is used to specify that something should be drawn transparently, or that the background should not be filled.

`ColorNone`s singleton instance is accessed using the expression `Color transparent`.

The superclass `code` instance variable has the value `Win32Constants.CLR_NONE`.'!
