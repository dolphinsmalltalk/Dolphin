LayoutManager comment: 'LayoutManager is the abstract superclass for classes that wish to implement the <layoutManager> protocol for the automatic arrangement of views within a parent <compositeView>. Dolphin supplies a base set of general purpose concrete layout managers which are general purpose enough to cover most requirements. 

To define a new layout manager you must implement the <layoutManager> protocol methods in [subclass responsibility], and you will probably want to override #preferredLayoutExtentOf:context: as well.'!
