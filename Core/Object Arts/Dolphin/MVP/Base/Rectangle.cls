Rectangle comment: 'Instances of Rectangle represent a rectangular areas in a two dimensional Cartesian coordinate system. A Rectangle contains two Points; origin, which specifies the top left corner, and corner, which indicates the bottom right corner of the region described. 

A Rectangle is typically created by sending the method #corner: to an instance of Point, although a number of other instance creation class methods are also provided:

100@100 corner: 150@150

Rectangles inhabit the same Smalltalk standard "left-handed" coordinate system as do Points; i.e. with the y axis increasing downwards. Because of this, in a non-empty Rectangle, the origin is always expected to be above and to the left of the corner. Rectangles that are not in this normalised state can be sent the message #normalize to answer a copy that is. Many of the operation messages on Rectangles will assume that the receiver is normalised.

(150@150 corner: 100@100) normalize'!
