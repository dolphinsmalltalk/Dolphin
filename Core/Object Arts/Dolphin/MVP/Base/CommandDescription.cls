CommandDescription comment: 'A CommandDescription acts as the fundamental source for all MVP user interface commands. An instance of this class holds the command itself, a textual description of the command''s function and, optionally, an accelerator key that may trigger the command action when used within a menu. The command can be a <Message>, <Symbol> or, indeed, any object that responds to the <commandMessage> protocol. For most commands, symbols are prevalent but messages can sometimes be more convenient, especially if the command is to carry parameters, such as in dynamically constructed menus (e.g. the browser history list).

The MVP command framework operates as follows. There exist a number of potential command sources which each carry a CommandDescription that dictates the command that they wish to transmit. Possible command sources are Menus (drop-down and context), PushButtons and ToolbarButtons. When each source is actioned, the framework determines an appropriate view that can be considered as the origin for the command. Usually this is the view with focus but, in the case of context menus, it is the view beneath the context mouse click. 

The next stage is for the framework to determine a suitable target that will perform the command. It does this by creating a CommandQuery object containing the CommandDescription and then routing this via a number of potential command targets to determine if any of these are willing to accept responsibility for executing it. The actual route of command targets is determined by the active CommandPolicy for the originating view. The default CommandPolicy routes the CommandQuery''s in the sequence (view-presenter-model) and so on up the originating view''s parent chain. Normally this default policy is sufficient for most needs, but if necessary the policy can be specialized for a particular View class, or one can interfere with the routing of individual commands by explicitly setting the receiver (eventual target). At each stage in the routing, a potential target object is sent a #queryCommand: message with the CommandQuery as a parameter. This method is responsible for deciding whether the command should be considered as enabled at this target. It does so by setting CommandQuery>>enabled: to true where applicable. When the framework sees that a CommandQuery has been enabled it halts the routing process and gets around to performing command on the last target visited (or on the explicitly set target).

In order to perform the command, a Command object is created from the original CommandDescription and the designated receiver (target) object. The Command object is a valuable which, when performed, executes the command''s message against the receiver. When the command is actually being performed by the appropriate target method, it is possible for this to install some actions that can indicate how the operation may be undone or re-done. If these actions are set (and the top level Shell presenter to which the target belongs has been enabled to retain command history) then the framework will add the Command to its history once it has being performed. This allows an undo/redo facility to be added in a straightforward fashion to almost any application.

Another important aspect of the command framework is the ability to determine whether a particular CommandDescription can be performed without having to actually go-ahead and execute it. This is necessary in order to appropriately enable and disable the various command sources in the user interface. For example, when a menu is pulled down it must correctly display those commands which are enabled and disabled according to the current state of the application. The framework does this by using the same routing scheme that it uses when a command is to be executed. As a menu is pulled down or popped up, all of the commands within it are routed to determine whether their corresponding menu items should be enabled or not. At the same time onecan also indicate whether a particular command should appear checked (#checked:) or not, and specify whether it is considered the default command for its enclosing menu (#isDefault:).

As you can see, it is fairly straightforward for the command framework to determine when to query the commands that originate in menu items since the menus appear at defined times as requested by the user. However, for the various button command sources, the situation is somewhat more complicated since these are continuously visible and a is no obvious moment to perform the query routing. It is therefore necessary for the framework to route a CommandQuery at idle time in order to enable/disable and check/uncheck such items. This process could easily consume far too many processor cycles if not managed carefully. Consequently, the routing operation is only carried out if the user interface has been previously marked as being invalid. This is done by an application sending #invalidateUserInterface to any view or presenter whenever it considers that it has done something to change the application''s state. It is also done automatically by the framework following each command execution, since commands are very often responsible for changing such state.

The end result of a user interface component being marked by #invalidateUserInterface is that it will eventually receive a #validateUserInterface message; usually when the system next enters idle. The various button command sources use this message as a prompt to route a CommandQuery as described above. However, it is acceptable, and may sometimes be useful, to override #validateUserInterface to perform your own explicit interface validation.

The overall aim of the MVP command framework is to provide a flexible routing system to direct commands from their various sources to appropriate target objects that can execute them. The framework effectively implements the Chain Of Responsibility pattern, with the chain being determined by the active CommandPolicy.
