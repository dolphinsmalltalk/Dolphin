Shell comment: 'Shell implements the <topPresenter> protocol for presenters that are to appear in <topView>s; i.e. in top-level windows on the desktop.A Shell provides methods for supplying a caption for the associated <topView> and for maintaining a <HistoryList> of commands that have recently been performed within it. By default, a Shell will not maintain a command history unless it is explicitly told to do so using its #hasCommandHistory aspect. The purpose of maintaining a command history is to support the potential for #undo and #redo operations. For these to work successfully, each <Command> must be provided with an appropriate undo action after it has been performed. For more details see the comment for Command.

Instance Variables:
	caption		<readableString> or nil, holding and explicit caption for the associated <topView>.
	commandHistory	<HistoryList> or nil, holding a history of <Command>s that the presenter has recently performed.
