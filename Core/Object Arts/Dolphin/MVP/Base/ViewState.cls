ViewState comment: 'ViewState is capable of holding the relevant state of any <view> so that it may be restored to the same state at a later date. Normally, a ViewState is used during an image save to capture the state of all of the open views so that they may be restored when the image is restarted, but it is also used when dynamic recreation of a view is required such as when changing certainWindow styles that may only be applied when a Window is created.

	flag is set on aView and all its sub-views as they are traversed.
