Dialog comment: 'Dialog is an abstract <dialogPresenter> superclass for allowing model data to be displayed and edited within a top-level modal dialog window. The fact that a Dialog is modal means that any changes made to the displayed data are usually buffered and not written directly back to the model until they are explicitly applied. This happens, usually after clicking an OK button. Hence a user has the opportunity of cancelling out of a Dialog without any changes being made to the underlying model.

When designing a <dialogPresenter> it is necessary to make an initial decision as to how the model data should be edited. If the model is a mutable object, in that it is legal (and sensible) to modify it in place using its aspect accessors, then it is sensible to treat it as a simple <dialogPresenter> and it can be subclassed directly from Dialog itself. If, on the other hand, the model is to be immutable then the dialog should be implemented as a <valueDialogPresenter> and, most likely, be subclassed from the ValueDialog class. The decision made here can often be quite subtle. On the one hand, making changes to a mutable object seems the most direct approach, however, a <valueDialogPresenter> can often be more flexible because it can be connected to anything that supports the <valueModel> protocol. Often the choice comes down to this: If the identity of the underlying model data must remain unchanged then use a standard <dialogPresenter>. If this is not the case then a <valueDialogPresenter> will be more suitable.

From this point let us consider the operation of a standard <dialogPresenter>. When the dialog is created, and given a subject model on which to operate, an <AspectBuffer> is created onto this subject. This is used to buffer the changes to any of the subject''s aspects so that they do not affect the original data directly. It is this <AspectBuffer> that is used as the actual model for the <dialogPresenter>. Interestingly, the use of an <AspectBuffer> imposes an additional factor in the decision to use a standard <dialogPresenter> rather than a <valueDialogPresenter>, this being, that the subject model must be capable of being cloned correctly using #copy. For more details see the comment for AspectBuffer itself.

Instance Variables:
	confirmed		<boolean> indicating whether the dialog has been confirmed and the changes applied.
	ownerView	<topView> which owns the dialog and is suspended waiting for it to complete.
