MouseTracker comment: '`MouseTracker` is an `<Interactor`> that is used to manage the visual dragging of objects using the mouse. An instance should be created as the result of a mouse down event and once started using `#startTracking:` it captures the mouse and relays the drag messages that are part of the `<mouseTrackerTarget>` protocol to the target that is assigned to it. Once the drag has completed, and the originating button has been released, the mouse capture is also dropped. Tracking will also be cancelled if the user Alt+Tab''s to another application, or presses the ESC (escape) key (assuming the originating view still has focus).

## Instance Variables:
  `dragButton`		`Symbol` identifying the button (either #left or #right) that started the drag
  `target`			`<mouseTrackerTarget>` that receives tracking messages.
  `startPoint`		`Point` at which the drag started.
  `startPointLocal`	`Point` at which the drag started in local co-ordinates.
  `origin`			`Point` that identifies the origin of an object being dragged.
  `hysteresis`		`Point` extent of rectangle outside of which the mouse must move before a drag is started.
  `trackPosition`		`Point` holding the last drag position.
  `constrain`		`Symbol` or `nil`, identifying any drag constraint (either `#horizontal` or `#vertical`).

## Class Variables:
  `TrackingMask`	`<integer>` flags mask for flag indicating tracking is active.
