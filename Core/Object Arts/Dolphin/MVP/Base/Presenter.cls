Presenter comment: 'Presenter is an abstract class whose subclasses conform to <presenter> and represent components in the Model-View-Presenter framework. A presenter is the equivalent of a "user interface component" in the Dolphin MVP framework. It achieves flexibility over other component based architectures by allowing its data (its model) and its screen representation (its view) to be pluggable. Thus, one can change the way a user sees and manipulates a component by changing its view and one can change the data that the component is representing  by changing the model. Substituting a presenter''s model also allows several  presenter and view pairs to share and interact with the same data.  

SmalltalkSystem help: ''Overviews/ModelViewPresenter''.

A presenter determines how the user perceives, selects, and performs actions on its model data. Whereas a view is an output device to display model information, a presenter is generally a co-ordinator between actions received in the view and the changes these make to the model.  The changes that a presenter makes to its model are normally instigated either by a <commandSource> or by interpreting gestures that the view has received from the user. Such changes are usually applied to a selection of the model''s data that is held by the presenter.

You will find that presenters naturally fall into two camps; those that are generic simple components such as text editors,  lists and trees, and those that are specific to application models. Often the more specific presenters are <compositePresenter>s since these can be used to handle simultaneous user interaction with multiple aspects of a model. Note that in contrast to previous versions of Dolphin, in Dolphin 5 both <compositePresenter>s and <presenters> can be subclassed directly off <Presenter> (the old CompositePresenter class has gone and is replaced with a global variable that aliases Presenter). 

When implementing any <presenter> the following basic steps should be followed:

1. Decide what sort of presenter is being implemented and, therefore, its position in the class hierarchy. Normally, you will subclass below one of (Presenter, Shell, Dialog, ValueDialog or ValuePresenter). See the comments for these classes to understand more about when to use each type.

2. Implement a #defaultModel class method to answer a default model suitable for the presenter. This model can be superseded as the presenter is instantiated, or replaced later, but it must be available for default instantiations.

3. All presenters inherit a default view resource name of "Default view". It is recommended that if you only intend to have one view onto your presenter then it should be named this in the resource manager. Otherwise, it will be necessary to override the #defaultView class method to answer the actual name of the view resource you wish to use.

4. Next create a view resource for the presenter and associate it with the presenter''s class. This is normally done using the View Composer. The easiest way to create a new view is to write click on the presenter class in the Class Hierarchy Browser and choose the "New view" command. This will launch the View Composer on a copy of the closest "Default view" found for the presenter. If you are designing the default view itself then remember to save it under the name that will be answered by the #defaultView method (see above).

5. Override the #createSchematicWiring method on the instance side in order to "wire up" any event handlers that your presenter might need.

When implementing a <compositePresenter> the following basic steps should be followed (after the steps described above):

1. Add instance variables for each of the sub-presenters that will make up the composite. Often one uses sub-presenters to display/edit different aspects of the model, so you will require one variable for each aspect that is to be "presented"..

2. Implement a #createComponents instance side method. In here, the sub-presenters are created, named, and assigned to the appropriate instance variables. The names that you give them (not the instance variable names) are important since they indicate which sub-views, within the presenter''s associated <compositeView> will get connected to the various sub-presenters.

3. It has been mentioned that the #createSchematicWiring method may need to be overriden to specify appropriate event handling. This is much more likely to be required when creating a <compositePresenter> since you are liable to want to hook up to any events triggered by the sub-presenters and redirect them to specific methods within the new presenter class.

4. The next stage is to set up the models of the sub-presenters. Normally you will do this by overriding #model:. If your sub-presenters are to be used to display aspects of the <compositePresenter>''s model (as is common) then you should use this opportunity to assign appropriate <ValueAspectAdapter>s onto these aspects to them. 

Instance Variables:
	model		<Object> holding the model data that the presenter is to manipulate.
	view		<view> displaying the model data and supplying UI gestures and commands to the presenter.
	parentPresenter	<compositePresenter> that is the presenter''s parent or nil if it is a top level shell.
	events		<EventsCollection> holding the presenter''s event registrations.
	subPresenters	<OrderedCollection> of sub-presenters.
	names		<IdentityDictionary> mapping sub-presenter instances to their <readableString> names.
