CompositeValueAdaptor comment: 'CompositeValueAdaptor is a <valueModel> that provides access to the individual aspects of a composite object through ValueAspectAdaptors, but which treats changes through those aspect adaptors as changes to the whole composite object, i.e. any change to one of its individual aspect causes a CompositeValueAdaptor to trigger a #valueChanged event. This is a useful when implementing a <ValuePresenter> for a composite object that is considered immutable by its clients.'!
