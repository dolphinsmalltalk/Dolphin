ValueHolder comment: 'A ValueHolder wraps an object and notifies its dependants when that object is replaced. Since ValueHolders are commonly used, there is a short cut available for creating them. Sending #asValue to any object will answer that object wrapped inside a ValueHolder. 

Instance Variables:
	value	<Object> which is the value held by the receiver.
