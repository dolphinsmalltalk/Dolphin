This package contains the basic Tree Models for use within the MVP framework. These are:
1) TreeModel - a generic <treeModel> that can be used to maintain a hierarchy of any objects and which has a configurable <searchPolicy>.
2) VirtualTreeModel - a pluggable tree model which itself doesn''t actually contain the hierarchy of elements, but which implements the <treeModel> protocol as a facade onto an externally maintained tree (e.g. onto the class hierarchy).
3) ExpandingTreeModel - a half-way house between the basic and virtual tree models that maintains the hierarchy of nodes that have previously been visited. It is suitable for use in cases where the underlying tree may contain cyclic references (i.e. it is not a tree at all), and where a virtual tree is not suitable because the external model has no way to navigate up to parents and/or enumerating children is an expensive operation.'.
