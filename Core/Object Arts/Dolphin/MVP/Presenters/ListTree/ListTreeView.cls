ListTreeView comment: 'Copyright © Chris Uppal, 2002 - 2004.

An implementation of a kind of TreeView that supports multiple columns.  It uses the same technique as (I guess) M$ do for Outlook Express''s message folder.  I.e. it''s really a ListView that indents the primary column''s items according to how deep in the tree they are, and uses the rows ''state'' images to show open/closed indicators.  There is also a version of this class that supports multiple-selection, but is otherwise identical (see MultipleSelectionListTreeView).

There are some examples of use in the class-side category ''examples'', but to save you the effort of going to look for them:
	self example1.	"do it"
	self example2a.	"do it"
	self example2b.	"do it"
	self example2c.	"do it"

Instances can be used with TreePresenters (e.g. TreePresenter.ListTree view), ListPresenters (e.g. ListPresenter.ListTree view), or with the specialised presenter class, TreeViewPresenter, which knows more about ListTreeView than the pre-packaged Presenter classes do.  

The multi-select version, MultipleSelectionListTreeView, can be used with ListPresenters (e.g. ListPresente.Multi-select ListTree view) and with ProperTreeViewPresenter.


General Notes on Usage:
----------------------------------------

Just like any other View really.  Nothing too special.  This package adds pre-packaged ListTreeViews to TreePresenter and TreeView.

As far as possible these act pretty much like TreeViews or ListViews.  However, I''ve added three attributes for controlling sorting.  These are #sortBlock, the <diadicValuable> to use to sort the tree (items are sorted *within* the list of their siblings); and then two attributes that restrict the use of the sort block: #doSortRoots, a boolean that can be used to turn off sorting the roots; and #doSortChildren, a <monadicValuable> that is used to selectively enable sorting of each item''s children.

Instances trigger four additional events off the Presenter, #nodeAdded:, #nodeRemoved:, #nodeExpanded:, and #nodeCollapsed: which can be useful for controling the resources used for backing trees.  (This is something I''ve wanted in the standard TreeView for some time.)


Bugs
--------

I have found that using column images with a non-virtual instance will cause Windows errors.  I can''t find anything that I''m doing wrong to cause this, and none of the workarounds that I''ve tried fix it, so I''ll just have to leave a warning that it doesn''t work.  Sorry!!   (Stop press: a quick look suggests that this may now work in Dolphin 5.0.3, which has had changes to the way non-virtual ListViews work.)

For some reason Window''s always leaves space for the primary row''s icon, even if we''ve told it that we don''t want one.  I suspect that I''m missing something obvious, but I can''t find what I''m doing wrong.  Programming Windows, perhaps...


Differences Between ListTreeView and ListView
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The major difference is that the model maintained by the ListTreeView is a TreeModel.  If you clip it to a ListPresenter and give it a ListModel, then the ListTreeView will generate an internal VirtualTreeModel from its three block-valued aspects, #hasChildrenBlock, #getChildrenBlock, and #getParentBlock.  The ListModel used by the presenter is used only to populate the TreeModel''s roots, and is thereafter ignored.  The big effect of this on TreePresenter is that the #list should be treated as readonly, since it is being maintained by the ListTreeView.

You can also supply a TreeModel to a ListPresenter/ListTreeView pair.  This seems to work OK, but of course there may be problems.  The reason you might want to do that is that you want the multi-selection awareness of a ListPresenter, but need to manipulate an externally defined TreeModel.  Example 2b does this.

A minor difference is that sorting is not dispatched via the ListPresenter, since the ListPresenter attempts to manipulate the #list directly.  If a ListTreeView is connected to a TreePresenter or ListPresenter then it does its own sorting without consulting its presenter.  If it is connected to a proper ListTreePresenter (or subclass) then it dispatches via the presenter in the normal way.

The #hasCheckBoxes aspect is not supported, since that (internally to Windows) uses the same ''state'' images as we want to use for our open/closed indicators.


Differences between ListTreeView and TreeView
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The biggest deficiency (that I know about so far) is that ListTreeView does not draw tree ''lines''.  Since M$ don''t do this either (in Outlook Express) I take it that this is OK.  If you find it too much of a failing, then don''t use this software... ;-)

The big gains over a TreeView is that a ListTreeView supports additional ListViewColumns and that MultipleSelectionListTreeView supports multiple selection (duh).  As far as I know things like per-column images, owner-draw, etc all work, but I haven''t tried everything.

One or two minor aspects of TreeView, like #isMonoExpandable and #hasHotTracking, are not implemented or are simulated badly.

As with ListPresener, sorting is not dispatched via the TreePresenter but handled internally, and the #hasCheckBoxes aspect is not supported.

Since the tree navigation key bindings are not quite consistant across M$ products, I''ve tried to find and implement a sensible compromise among them.  Please let me know if I''ve missed any.  I''ve also tried to come up with sensible implementations for the case where there are multiple selections.  Sometimes they will seem odd, but I don''t think that''s avoidable.  One touch I like is that expanding any selected item while holding down the <shift> key will automatically select its children too.

Instances can be set not to keep a record of which nodes were expanded when their parents are closed.  This, again, can save resources, but it''s mainly because the default Window''s tree behaviour irritates me.  It makes no difference for small trees, but is a bloody nuisance for large ones.  This is controlled by the #retainExpanded aspect; standard Windows behaviour is the default.

Instances can be set not to collapse the entire subtree below a node in response to #onTreeChanged: notification.  The default is to collapse the sub-tree because that''s what TreeView does.  This is controlled by the #useSmartUpdate aspect.
