RadioButton comment: 'RadioButton is a <valueView> implementing the Windows "BUTTON" class in a BS_AUTORADIOBUTTON style. The <valueModel> associated with a RadioButton must always yield a <boolean> value once mapped through the installed type converter. RadioButtons will normally be used in a group in conjunction with a <RadioButtonSetPresenter>.

Windows'' standard behaviour for radio buttons is that a among a group of such buttons under the same parent only a single button may be selected at any time (hence the ''radio'' button designation, a reference to old-fashioned radios that used such controls for selection between the different frequence bands, etc). RadioButton itself does not implement this behaviour; although Windows will ensure that only one radio button (with the style BS_AUTORADIOBUTTON) within a parent is selected at any one time, the deselected radio button receives no event to notify it of the change. Therefore we rely on a ''grouping'' presenter to ensure that the models of a group of radio buttons are consistent. <RadioButtonSetPresenter> is one such presenter that performs this task and implements the standard behaviour.
