An application using DBConnection. It is intended primarily for testing app deployment rather than to do anything useful.

## Deployment

Note: When working with  ''Database Connection'', always deploy from a freshly started image as finalization of old statements and connections may cause errors during the deployment. If this happens and the crash dump log shows a faulting call into the ODBCLibrary to free a handle, just restart the image and repeat the deployment.

```
Smalltalk developmentSystem saveImage.	"Save the image if you don''t want to lose changes"
(ImageStripper new)
	rootPackage: DumpTable owningPackage;
	executableName: ''dumptable.exe'';
	preserveAspectSetters: false;
	stripDeprecatedMethods: true;
	deploy
