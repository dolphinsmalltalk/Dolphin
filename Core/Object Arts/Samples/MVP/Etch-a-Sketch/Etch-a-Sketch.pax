EtchASketch is a component that emulates the (once) popular Etch-a-Sketch toy. It allows "ink" to be drawn onto a sketch pad by means of two "knobs"; one for horizontal movement and one for vertical movement. In the basic view the knobs are represented by sliders. The EtchASketch makes use of the Scribble component for its sketch area.

## Examples

To create an Etch-a-Sketch document window evaluate:

```
es := EtchASketchDocument show.
```

You can draw in the sketch area using the scroll bars or by using the mouse directly. Now try creating a Scribble pad that uses the same model:
```
Scribble showOn: es model.
```
Now anything you draw in one will immediately be reflected in the other.

## Deployment:

```
Smalltalk developmentSystem saveImage.	"Save the image if you don''t want to lose changes"
EtchASketchDocument show.
(ImageStripper new)
	rootPackage: EtchASketch owningPackage;
	executableName: ''EtchASketch.exe'';
	preserveAspectSetters: false;
	stripDeprecatedMethods: true;
	deploy
```

And to examine the content: 

```
Smalltalk developmentSystem browseDeploymentLog: ''EtchASketch.xml''.
```

Or as Xml:
```
XmlPad openOn: ''EtchASketch.xml''
```
