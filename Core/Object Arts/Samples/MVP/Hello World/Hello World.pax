Copyright (c) Object Arts Ltd, 1998-2000.

This package contains a sample "Hello World" class. 
To open a "Hello World" window evaluate:

```
HelloWorld show
```

## Deployment:

The sample does not have a RuntimeSessionManager, so we need to open an instance. This method of deployment is not recommended for real applications. You should always implement a RuntimeSessionManager that opens your main application window. This ensures that everything is initialized properly through normal code paths, rather than relying on restoring correctly from an instance saved in the application.

```
Smalltalk developmentSystem saveImage.	"Save the image if you don''t want to lose changes"
HelloWorld show.
(ImageStripper new)
	rootPackage: HelloWorld owningPackage;
	executableName: ''HelloGui.exe'';
	preserveAspectSetters: false;
	stripDeprecatedMethods: true;
	deploy
```

And to examine the content: 

```
Smalltalk developmentSystem browseDeploymentLog: ''HelloGui.xml''
"Or view the log"
XmlPad openOn: ''HelloGui.xml''
```
