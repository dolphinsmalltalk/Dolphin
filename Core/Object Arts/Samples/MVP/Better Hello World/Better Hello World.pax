package := Package name: 'Better Hello World'.
package paxVersion: 2.1;
	preDeclareClassesOnLoad: false;
	basicComment: 'The standard “Hello World” sample application that comes pre-loaded the Dolphin Samples folder is not ideal because it doesn’t show how to build Hello World in the normal Dolphin Model-View-Presenter framework. Whilst this makes it quick and easy do to, it’s educational value is limited and some users have found it rather confusing.

This example shows an Hello World Model-View-Presenter component consisting of a ValueModel, a composite ShellView (drawn with the ViewComposer) and a BetterHelloWorld presenter class that ties these pieces together. You can follow a tutorial video at: https://youtu.be/u3I3AYeeIec and then an explanation of what makes MVP a good idea at: https://youtu.be/1LOR2tg8YOg. If you follow the tutorial directly then you''ll need to uninstall this package first.

## Deployment:

The sample does not have a RuntimeSessionManager, so we need to open an instance. This method of deployment is not recommended for real applications. You should always implement a RuntimeSessionManager that opens your main application window. This ensures that everything is initialized properly through normal code paths, rather than relying on restoring correctly from an instance saved in the application.

```
Smalltalk developmentSystem saveImage.	"Save the image if you don''t want to lose changes"
UI.Examples.BetterHelloWorld show.
(ImageStripper new)
	rootPackage: UI.Examples.BetterHelloWorld owningPackage;
	executableName: ''BetterWorld.exe'';
	preserveAspectSetters: false;
	stripDeprecatedMethods: true;
	"logReferencesToClasses: true;"
	deploy
```

And to examine the content: 

```
Smalltalk developmentSystem browseDeploymentLog: ''BetterWorld.xml''
"Or view the log"
UI.Examples.XmlPad openOn: ''BetterWorld.xml''
