Copyright (c) Object Arts Ltd, 2000-2004.

Catenate is a sample command line application that performs the same function as the Unix ''cat'' and DOS ''type'' commands (i.e. it copies the files specified on its command line to the standard output stream).

This sample demonstrates a simple use of standard I/O streams in a Dolphin console application. Example usage:

	cat catenate.pax catenate.cls >out

## Deployment

```
Smalltalk developmentSystem saveImage.	"Save the image if you don''t want to lose changes"
(ImageStripper new)
	rootPackage: Catenate owningPackage;
	executableName: ''cat.exe'';
	preserveAspectSetters: false;
	stripDeprecatedMethods: true;
	deploy
```

And to examine the content: 

```
Smalltalk developmentSystem browseDeploymentLog: ''cat.xml''.
"Or just view the log"
XmlPad filename: ''cat.xml''
```'.
