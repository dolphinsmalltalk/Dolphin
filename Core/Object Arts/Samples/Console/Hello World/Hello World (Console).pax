Copyright (c) Object Arts Ltd, 2000-2002.

This package contains a non-GUI (console or command line) implementation of the classic "Hello World" program. This is just about the simplest program one can construct. It consists of a single class, CommandLineHelloWorld, with a single method, #main. A .EXE console application can be created by deploying this package using Dolphin''s Lagoon deployment wizard (available in the Professional and higher editions). The result can then be run from a command prompt or DOS box. 

CommandLineHelloWorld is actually a specialised <SessionManager>, and is itself a subclass of a session manager class specialised for command line applications, namely <ConsoleSessionManager>. ConsoleSessionManager contains a series of startup applications that are similar in purpose to the startup code linked with every C program from the C runtime library. Like a C program the first point at which user code takes control is the #main function or method. CommandLineHelloWorld is such a simple program, that it is reasonable to implement it entirely in the #main method, which looks like this (with comments removed):

```
main
    self stdout nextPutAll: ''Hello World!!''; cr
```

All this does is to access a Smalltalk stream, which is attached to the standard output file of the process, and write a string of characters onto it, followed by a carriage return. Just as a C program exits when its main() function returns, so the Dolphin console application (when deployed) will exit when the #main method returns.

''Hello World'' is such a simple program, that it hardly needs testing and debugging (other than just deploying it, if you have Dolphin Professional, and running it). For anything more complicated the recommended approach is to write the application as a set of classes. The main class should have an instance created in the #main method, which is then sent an appropriate message to invoke the application. Access to stdout and stdin streams can be achieved by sending the #stdout and #stdin messages to the session manager, and similary for the arguments (accessible using the #argv message). Alternatively they could be passed as arguments to the message(s) sent to the application object. By taking this approach one can then test and debug the application from within the development environment, and when the first attempt is made to access either stdin or stdout a console will be opened automatically. This console will accept input, and displays the output written to stdout. Note that it may be necessary to flush the stream to see the output.

To test out the use of the console from a GUI application (the development environment) try evaluating:

```
  SessionManager current stdout nextPutAll: ''Dolphin is getting cooler every day''; cr; flush.
```

(Be aware that console might pop up in the background somewhere).

You can also try to read some input from the console, as below. When you do this the system will block until you''ve entered at least 5 characters into the console and pressed enter/return: 

```
   SessionManager current stdin next: 5
```

If however the operation is run in an independent process then the Dolphin GUI will not be blocked:

```
   [MessageBox notify: ''You typed: '', (SessionManager current stdin next: 5) printString] fork.
```

## Deployment:

Deployment should always be initiated in a freshly started image for best results. Do not attempt to deploy the application with the console window open.

```
Smalltalk developmentSystem saveImage.	"Save the image if you don''t want to lose changes"
(ImageStripper new)
	rootPackage: CommandLineHelloWorld owningPackage;
	executableName: ''HelloCli.exe'';
	isToGo: false; "Just to see how small the image is without the VM"
	preserveAspectSetters: false;
	stripDeprecatedMethods: true;
	deploy
```

And to examine the content: 

```
"Open a browser on the classes and methods that were deployed"
Smalltalk developmentSystem browseDeploymentLog: ''HelloCli.xml''.
"Or just view the log"
UI.Examples.XmlPad filename: ''HelloCli.xml''
```'.
