	basicComment: 'Dolphin Smalltalk Autoplay Sample. 
Copyright (c) Object Arts Ltd, 2001-2002.

Autoplay is an application for use as a CD-ROM autoplay setup menu. As a sample Autoplay demonstrates:
- Embedding the Microsoft Web Browser control in a Dolphin application (see also the Simple Web Browser sample)
- How to prevent multiple instances of an application being started (see AutoPlaySessionManager>>allowDuplicates)
- Simple command line processing (see AutoplaySessionManager>>main)
- Sizing a shell to precisely the right dimensions to fit a given client area.

Although simple, Autoplay is capable of practical use, indeed Object Arts used it for the Dolphin Pro Trial distributed at Smalltalk Solutions 2001, and we will certainly use it again. Autoplay is now (as of Dolphin 5) deployed in "ToGo" mode, and so does not require the Dolphin VM to run. However to be sure that it will run on all machines, it is a good idea to place the C runtime libraries (MSVCRT.DLL and MSVCP60.DLL) in the root directory of the CD along with Autoplay.exe.

Autoplay can display a single page of HTML (specified by the first command line argument, but defaulting to ''autorun.htm'') at a specified fixed size (specified by the second command line argument but defaulting to 480x480). Normally this HTML file would contain little but an IMG tag and a map to specify the location of links in the map. When the user clicks on the links the HREF associated with the link is passed to the ShellExecute() API, the result of which is to spawn off the appropriate application in another window to open that particular type of file. This means that a separate explorer window is opened to browse the CD (should that option be present) and avoids the user being prompted to save/open the setup executable/MSI.

For example:

	<HTML>
	  <HEAD>
	    <TITLE>My Application</TITLE>
	  </HEAD>
	  <BODY scroll=no leftMargin=0 topMargin=0 bottomMargin=0 rightMargin=0>
	    <MAP name="mymap">
	      <AREA href="ReadMe.htm" shape="rect" coords="345, 147, 455, 169">
  	      <AREA href="setup.exe" shape="rect" coords="283, 174, 455, 197">
	      <AREA href="./" shape="rect" coords="378, 266, 456, 286">
	    </MAP>
	    <IMG border="0" src="setupmenu.jpg" usemap="#mymap" width="480" height="480">
	  </BODY>
	</HTML>

The scroll and margin attributes associated with the BODY tag are important to prevent the Web Browser Control displaying an unwanted scrollbar and surrounding the graphic with a border of blank space. The areas in the map respectively relate to the "Read Me", "Install XXX", and "Browse this CD" links in the graphic.

CD-ROM Autoplay also requires an Autorun.inf file to be located in the root directory of the CD-ROM. The content of this .inf file is of the following format (for example):

	[autorun]
	OPEN=autoplay.exe autorun.htm 480@480
	ICON=AUTOPLAY.EXE,0

This specifies to run the autoplay executable (deployable from this package) to display ''autorun.htm'' in the root directory with area for a 480x480 image/page. The ''command line'' arguments are parsed by <AutoplaySessionManager> and passed to <Autoplay> before it is shown. The separator between the width and height is not important as long as it is not whitespace.
