This package demonstrates how to create your own DolphinSure certificates for your applications. 

If you are to issue your own certificates you will first need to create a root certificate for yourself as a certifying authority.  In the sample this is MyOwnCertificationAuthorityCertificate. Look in the class side #privateKey method for details on how to generate the public/private key pair and how to add these keys to the #privateKey and #publicKey methods. Once you have these key methods in place then you can generate the certificate itself.  Take a look at the comment for #new which shows how to generate the binary store bytes array which must be pasted into the #new method itself.  At this point you can reconstitute an instance of your certification authority certificate by evaluating MyOwnCertificationAuthorityCertificate new.

Once you have this root certificate you can create a class, MyOwnCertificate, for your user certificates. Here you need to specify the #rootCertificateClass method and have this answer MyOwnCertificationAuthorityCertificate. Now you can generate user certificates using #serial:owner:details:. For more details take a look at the comment in this method.

MyOwnCertificate serial: ''MY100002'' owner: ''My Own Company Inc.'' details: ''security@company.com''

Evaluate the above to create an example certificate for My Own Company inc.'.
