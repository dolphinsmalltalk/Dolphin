IEnumRECT comment: 'IEnumRECT is a sample specialization of the generic COM enumeration interface, IEnumXXX. 

See p115, Chapter2, "Inside OLE 2e", Kraig Brockschmidt, Microsoft Press.

In Dolphin each COM interface is represented as a class, derived from the IUnknown class, which, not surprisingly, implements the IUnknown interface. The IEnumRECT interface Kraig defines is implemented in Dolphin as a subclass of IEnumXXXX, which provides a generic implementation for COM enumerators, and consequently IEnumRECT need only define a single method, #elementClass, which answers the type of object being enumerated over. Occassionally enerators may require a little more effort (for example when there is memory or ref. counts to be managed), but #elementClass is typically all there is to it.
