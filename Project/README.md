# Project
This directory provides the basic components needed to support one possible application developer workflow. 

### Rename This Directory (optional)
If you downloaded Dolphin 7 as a zip file then you can simply start working in this directory. If you are using `git` then you should rename this directory (to avoid conflicts with the Dolphin checkout) and create a git checkout in the new directory (to handle your application development). 

### Edit Files (optional)
You may change the name of the package and class from 'Project' to something else. This will require edits to the files. As you create your own packages, you may add them to Project>>#contents or you may use other means to load them into your image.

### Boot the Image
Run `BootProject.cmd` and you should now have a development image in a subdirectory.
